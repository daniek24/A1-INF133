--Readme document for Daniel Kim, daniek24@uci.edu --

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features

Basic HTML Heading structure, images for the project cards, href links, semantic HTML tags.

(b) CSS features

Lots of class and subclass tags, colors, helvetica font because it's my favorite.

(c) Advanced features

Custom Project Cards with styling and image container, and Javascript Mouse tracking on the top heading banner.


3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.

Yes there were some, but I didn't really understand them so for the time being I left them as is, but in the future I'd like to understand those accessibility concerns better and how I can fix them.

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

About 6 hours total.

5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

I prompted Claude for a starter template which I then worked off of. The Query I used was fairly vague: "give me some starter html for a portfolio website", as I wanted to do more personalization and custom features myself.
Additionally, for the mouse hovering feature, I found and slightly altered an online tutorial which demonstrated the effect I wanted: https://www.30secondsofcode.org/css/s/mouse-cursor-gradient-tracking/#the-gradient-s-css 

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

I worked alone for this one.

7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

No.
